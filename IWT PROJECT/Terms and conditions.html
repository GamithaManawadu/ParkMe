  <h1 style="background-color:#5FF9FF; text-align:center">PARKME END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT</h1>
  
  <p style="text-align:center;">>Welcome to ParkMe! Please note that each of our website and smartphone applications are provided solely to assist customers in gathering parking<br> information, determining the availability and location of parking, and/or making legitimate parking reservations, and for no other purposes.</p>
  
  <div  style="text-align:center; color:red; font-size:22px;" >		
  Part I - Reservation Services</div>
  
  <p style="text-align:center;">1. Prepaid Parking Reservations. ParkMe provides the Reservation Services to Users for the sole purposes of providing Users information on the <br>
  location and apparent availability of parking and assisting them in securing parking at participating third-party off-streetparking locations,<br>
   including but not limited to, parking garages and parking lots (each, a “Garage” and collectively, “Garages”). In response to a User’s online<br>
  request for a Garage reservation through the ParkMe Site or a ParkMe Application, ParkMe communicates directly with the applicable Garage regarding<br>
    such reservation request.  The availability of reservations is determined at the time of a User’s query, and ParkMe makes no representation or warranty<br>
   (i) regarding the accuracy of any data (including, but not limited to, reservation availability data) received from any Garage, or (ii) on behalf of any<br>
   Garage in any capacity. ParkMe is in no way affiliated with or under common control with any Garage. You acknowledge that each   Garage may have<br>
   its own policies, terms, and conditions. Once a reservation is made by a User through the ParkMe Site or any ParkMe Application, ParkMe will  provide<br>
   confirmation of the reservation to such User by email or other means. By using the Reservation Services,you agree to receive reservation <br>
   confirmations  by email after booking a reservation through the Reservation Services.</p>
 
  
  <br><br>
  <div  style="text-align:center; color:red;font-size:22px;" >	
  2. Calculation of Parking Rates; Payment Authorization; Taxes</div>
  
  <p style="text-align:center;">You acknowledge that ParkMe pre-negotiates certain parking rates with Garages to facilitate the booking of reservations on your behalf. The parking<br>
  rate displayed on the ParkMe Site or Application is a combination of the pre-negotiated parking rate for parking spots reserved on your behalf by ParkMe<br>
  and the facilitation fee retained by ParkMe to compensate us for our services. You authorize ParkMe to book reservations for the total reservation price,<br>
  which includes the parking rate displayed on our website (or application), plus where applicable, service fees, and taxes.</p>
  
  <p style="text-align:center;">All reservations and other transactions consummated on the ParkMe Site or Application will be done by means of a credit card.  Whenever you submit a<br>
  credit card to ParkMe for any particular transaction and/or enter any credit card information for a particular credit card, you confirm that you are<br>
  permitted to use that credit card.  When you fund a transaction, you authorize us (and our designated payment processor) to charge the full and total<br>
  amount of the reservation price to such credit card immediately.  You also authorize us to collect and store that credit card (and information<br>
  regarding the identification thereof), along with other related transaction information.</p>
  
  
  <div  style="text-align:center; color:red;color:red;font-size:22px;" >	
  3. Prices.</div>
  
  <p style="text-align:center;">The price of the parking will be as quoted on the ParkMe Site from time to time except in cases of error.  Prices may change from time to time and at<br>
  any time, but any such changes will not affect bookings already accepted.  Despite ParkMe’s best efforts, some of the parking listed on the website may be<br>
  incorrectly priced. PARKME EXPRESSLY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CORRECT ANY PRICING ERRORS ON OUR WEBSITE AND/OR ON<br> PENDING RESERVATIONS MADE UNDER AN INCORRECT
  PRICE. IN SUCH EVENT, IF AVAILABLE, WE WILL OFFER YOU <br>THE OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP YOUR PENDING RESERVATION AT THE CORRECT PRICE OR WE WILL CANCEL YOUR RESERVATION<br>
  WITHOUT PENALTY. ParkMe is under no obligation to provide parking reservations to you at an incorrect (lower) price, even after you have been sent<br>
  confirmation of your booking.  We do not guarantee that pricing for parking reservations will be the best available at the time of booking.</p>
  

  <div  style="text-align:center; color:red;font-size:22px;" >	
  4. Your Account</div>
  
  <p style="text-align:center;">You may (but are not required to) create an account with ParkMe through the ParkMe Site and ParkMe Applications (“Account”) in order to use the Reservation<br>
  Services or redeem coupons. When registering for an Account, you must provide true, accurate, current and complete data about yourself on the ParkMe registration<br>
  form (“Registration Data”). You also agree to promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. You are solely responsible<br>
  for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account and the information in your Account, and you are solely responsible for all use of your Account, whether or<br>
  not authorized by you. You agree to immediately notify ParkMe of any unauthorized use of your Account or any other breach of security related to your use of the<br>
  Services.</p>
